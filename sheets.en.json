The recommended temperature is 22ºC and is indicated by the dot on the lower regulator.\n\nThe top switch has three possible positions:\n\n - Left (Moon Icon): Heating OFF.\n\n - Center (Sun Icon): Heating ON. The desired temperature is regulated using the lower dial.\n\n - Right (Clock Icon): Used to program the heating. If you wish to program it, please let us know and we will be happy to help you.",
